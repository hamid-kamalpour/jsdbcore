# JSDbCore

A full client-side javascript database.

JSDbCore is a library created to simplify new Html5 javascript database API's.<br>
It uses Html5 technologies like IndexedDb and WebSql to implement a client-side complete database, 
enabling a new dimension for web apps that will run totally offline, finishing with the server-side depencie.

This is a start, so only the indexeddb api is parciatially complete.

*This technologies are experimental, so could apper some bugs, and the api could change.
** Check the brownser compatibility before try.
