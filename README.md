# JSDbCore

A full client-side javascript database library.

JSDbCore is a library created to simplify new Html5 javascript database API's.<br>
It uses Html5 technologies like IndexedDb and WebSql to implement a client-side complete database, 
enabling a new dimension for web apps that will run totally offline, finishing with the server-side depencie.

This is a start, so only the indexeddb api is partially complete.

*This technologies are experimental, so could apper some bugs, and the api could change.<br>
*Check the brownser compatibility before try.
## Documentation 

The documentation isn't complete, but a parcial copy is in the repositories.
To see a example, download and execute the index.html example. 

Inside index.html is a script configuring a database, inserting a record, deleting and using the findAll
and findAllByCriteria methods.

Use this and the getting started pdf as a guide while the official documentation isn't released.
